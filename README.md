# blackhat-usa-2022-demos
Demos for the Blackhat USA 2022 talk "Taking Kerberos to the Next Level".

This is the slides and demos for James Forshaw ([@tiraniddo](https://twitter.com/tiraniddo)) and Nick Lander ([@monoxgas](https://twitter.com/monoxgas)) presentation.

The demos require an updated version of the NtObjectManager PowerShell module built from source. They do not work on the version in the PowerShell gallery.

Get the source code for the module from [Github](https://github.com/googleprojectzero/sandbox-attacksurface-analysis-tools)
